## Info:
Welcome to TwilightsPoint.io. This is a website portfolio that has many functions like showcasing my work in graphic development and programming, being a resume online, and location of contact.  
Most of my work is done with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Premiere, and Adobe Illustrator. I have been programming for three years now and working with graphic design for about a year and a half.
